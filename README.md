# TerraLevel - Made for Hack Club Daydream

TerraLevel is a simple platformer game made for Daydream Game Jam Padova by Greg7327, Mat-dev-08 and Fleny113.

The game has three levels where you have to reach the top to proceed to the next one. Falling too hard will reset you to the start of the level, and you will have to sacrifice 100 points to get another life!

Go, little knight, go!
